Sentry's SvelteKit SDK enables automatic reporting of errors and performance data.

<Note>

The minimum supported **SvelteKit version is `1.0.0`**. This SDK is designed to work best with **Vite 4.2** and newer.
Older Vite versions might not be able to generate source maps correctly.

<Note>

The SvelteKit SDK is designed to work with SvelteKit's [Node adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapter-node).
Other adapters may work but we don't support them at this time.
We're looking into extending first-class support to [more adapters](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) in the future.
