Collecting request and response bodies is an opt-in feature. That's because the best way to avoid getting PII into Sentry is by not adding URLs of endpoints that may contain PII.
Additionally, Sentry attempts to [scrub](/product/data-management-settings/scrubbing/server-side-scrubbing/) certain types of sensitive data from request and response bodies, if you accidentally opt-in to a URL that includes this type of data. This mechanism happens on our ingestion service, before data hits our disks. This is a best effort approach which pattern-matches the content with things like credit card information, social security numbers, and [passwords](https://github.com/search?q=repo%3Agetsentry%2Frelay%20PASSWORD_KEY_REGEX&type=code).
